_constants.FRAME_END = {"value": 206, "message" : ""};
_constants.REPLY_SUCCESS = {"value": 200, "message" : "Indicates that the method completed successfully. This reply code is reserved for future use - the current protocol design does not use positive confirmation and reply codes are sent only in case of an error."};
_constants.CONTENT_TOO_LARGE = {"value": 311, "message" : "The client attempted to transfer content larger than the server could accept at the present time. The client may retry at a later time."};
_constants.NO_CONSUMERS = {"value": 313, "message" : "When the exchange cannot deliver to a consumer when the immediate flag is set. As a result of pending data on the queue or the absence of any consumers of the queue."};
_constants.CONNECTION_FORCED = {"value": 320, "message" : "An operator intervened to close the connection for some reason. The client may retry at some later date."};
_constants.INVALID_PATH = {"value": 402, "message" : "The client tried to work with an unknown virtual host."};
_constants.ACCESS_REFUSED = {"value": 403, "message" : "The client attempted to work with a server entity to which it has no access due to security settings."};
_constants.NOT_FOUND = {"value": 404, "message" : "The client attempted to work with a server entity that does not exist."};
_constants.RESOURCE_LOCKED = {"value": 405, "message" : "The client attempted to work with a server entity to which it has no access because another client is working with it."};
_constants.PRECONDITION_FAILED = {"value": 406, "message" : "The client requested a method that was not allowed because some precondition failed."};
_constants.FRAME_ERROR = {"value": 501, "message" : "The sender sent a malformed frame that the recipient could not decode. This strongly implies a programming error in the sending peer."};
_constants.SYNTAX_ERROR = {"value": 502, "message" : "The sender sent a frame that contained illegal values for one or more fields. This strongly implies a programming error in the sending peer."};
_constants.COMMAND_INVALID = {"value": 503, "message" : "The client sent an invalid sequence of frames, attempting to perform an operation that was considered invalid by the server. This usually implies a programming error in the client."};
_constants.CHANNEL_ERROR = {"value": 504, "message" : "The client attempted to work with a channel that had not been correctly opened. This most likely indicates a fault in the client layer."};
_constants.UNEXPECTED_FRAME = {"value": 505, "message" : "The peer sent a frame that was not expected, usually in the context of a content header and body.  This strongly indicates a fault in the peer's content processing."};
_constants.RESOURCE_ERROR = {"value": 506, "message" : "The server could not complete the method because it lacked sufficient resources. This may be due to the client creating too many of some type of entity."};
_constants.NOT_ALLOWED = {"value": 530, "message" : "The client tried to work with some entity in a manner that is prohibited by the server, due to security settings or by some other criteria."};
_constants.NOT_IMPLEMENTED = {"value": 540, "message" : "The client tried to use functionality that is not implemented in the server."};
_constants.INTERNAL_ERROR = {"value": 541, "message" : "The server could not complete the method because of an internal error. The server may require intervention by an operator in order to resume normal operations."};
