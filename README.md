# About this Project

The javascript.client project implements the [WebSocket standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) in JavaScript. It provides a WebSocket client API and an AMQP client API that enables developers to build JavaScript applications that communicate with an RFC 6455 endpoint or an AMQP message broker over WebSocket.
